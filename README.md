Bracket Maker
============

Project for making single and double elimination brackets and matchups.

Inspired by years of wrestling and an addiction to tracking matchups throughout a tournament, bracketmaker will be designed to be an easy collection of algorithms and renderers that will produce single and double elimination brackets. Hopefully. :wrench:

*NOTE: As of this writing all code here is experimental and very likely will not function as expected or not at all. I will remove this warning when things are stable-ish.*
